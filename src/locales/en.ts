		bio: `I enjoy creating useful tools and
		automating routine tasks with Python.
		Actively learning web development, including frameworks
		such as FastAPI and Flask, as well as frontend basics with React.
		I like solving complex problems and constantly learning
		new things. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and
		build high-quality web applications. (But for now, it's not looking good).
		In my free time, I watch anime, play chess,
		and develop random weird stuff. Atheist, partial coffee enjoyer,
		and a bit of a perfectionist.`,
